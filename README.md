# Deprecation notice | March 22, 2016

NOTE: StrongLoop Gateway `strong-gateway` is **deprecated** as of 03/22/2016.
StrongLoop Gateway is now part of IBM API Connect, as the _Micro Gateway_ for securing and 
forwarding requests to a back-end API.  For more information, see https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect.

##Overview

###Tutorial

The purpose of this two-part tutorial is to show you how to implement the API
gateway as an OAuth 2.0 solution into an existing infrastructure.

####Part 1 - `notes-app-plain`

[`notes-app-plain`](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-gateway-demo/tree/master/notes-app-plain) is a simple web app
that renders a list of notes:

```
Notes
--------------
- Buy eggs
- Buy milk
- Buy sausages
```

The notes in this app are not stored on the web server, but are retrieved from
a separate server (API server) instead:

```
(Web Server)     (API Server)
 +--------+      +----------+
 | Client |----->| Resource |
 |        |<-----| Server   |
 +--------+      +----------+
```

In OAuth 2.0 terminology, the web server is a ["client"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.1) and the API server is a ["resource server"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.1).
We will be building the client and resource server apps in preparation for part
2 of the tutorial.

####Part 2 - `notes-app-gateway`

[`notes-app-gateway`](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-gateway-demo/tree/master/notes-app-gateway) is a seven-step tutorial that
demonstrates various features of the StrongLoop API Gateway. In each step, we
incrementally improve on the app from part 1 and cover a variety of topics as
we work through the transformation of `notes-app-plain` to `notes-app-gateway`.
Upon completion, the client will retrieve notes through the API gateway instead
of interacting directly with the API server:

```
(Web Server)       (API Gateway)        (API Server)
 +--------+      +---------------+      +----------+
 | Client |----->| Authorization |----->| Resource |
 |        |<-----| Server        |<-----| Server   |
 +--------+      +---------------+      +----------+
```

###Example - `oauth-playground`

This is a web app used to demonstrate various [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grant](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3)
flows:

- [Implicit](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LGW/Developer%27s+Guide#Developer%27sGuide-Implicitgrant)
- [Authorization Code](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LGW/Developer%27s+Guide#Developer%27sGuide-Authorizationcodegrant)
- [Client Credentials](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LGW/Developer%27s+Guide#Developer%27sGuide-Clientcredentialsgrant)
- [Resource Owner Password Credentials](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LGW/Developer%27s+Guide#Developer%27sGuide-Resourceownerpasswordcredentialsgrant)

We also include sample scripts for GUI-less workflows:

- [JWT Authorization Grant](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-gateway-demo/blob/master/oauth-playground/scripts/jwt-auth-grant.js)
- [JWT Client Authentication](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-gateway-demo/blob/master/oauth-playground/scripts/jwt-client-auth.js)
